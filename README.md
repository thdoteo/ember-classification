Dataset: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e6X56yLlmXzaeavJ-Nn8oG2kEtCHnC4T

## k-means

### Usage

**You have to put the ember dataset in `ember/`.**  

To run kmeans on the dataset and check its accuracy, follow the steps below.
```
cd kmeans/
make test
```

To run kmeans only, type the folowing command: `./kmeans 3 20 1.0 2351 900000 ../ember/Xtrain.dat out.dat`.

## Classifiers and neural networks

### Usage

Jupyter notebooks and .py source files are located in specific subfolders. However, we suggest using `Google Colab` to run our experiments.

### Step 2: Classification with machine learning

- Path: `python/step2-classifier_machine_learning`
